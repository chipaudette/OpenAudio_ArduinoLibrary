 /* Input is a block of f32 numbers.  Output is the peak signal amplitude
  * calculated over multiple blocks.  Useful for audio level response projects,
  * and general troubleshooting.
  * 
  * Status:  Tested 3.6 and 4.0, no known bugs
  * Functions:
  *   available(); Returns true if new peak data is available.
  *   read();      Read the new peak value.
  *                Return is absolute + or - peak value in float.
  *   readPeakToPeak();  Same, but the differnce in + and - values.
  * Examples:
  *   TestPeakRMS.ino
  *   Similar: File > Examples > Audio > Analysis > PeakAndRMSMeterStereo
  * Time: Measured Teensy 3.6 time for the update() is 10 microseconds,
  *     for 128 block size. For Teensy 4.0 this is about 4 mcroseconds.
  *
  * The two variables, min_sample and max_sample, are checked until
  * an available() takes place. This is fine if the statistics of the input data are
  * stationary, i.e., not changing with time.  But, if the process is not
  * stationary, be aware and do available() & read() at appropriate times.
