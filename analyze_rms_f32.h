 /* Input is a block of f32 numbers.  Output is the signal RMS amplitude
  * calculated over multiple blocks.  Useful for audio level response projects,
  * and general troubleshooting.
  * 
  * Status: Tested 3.6 and T4.0  No known bugs.
  * Functions:
  *   available();  Returns true if new RMS data is available.
  *   read();       Read the new RMS value. Return is rms value in float.
  * Examples:    
  *   TestPeakRMS.ino
  *   Similar: File > Examples > Audio > Analysis > PeakAndRMSMeterStereo
  * Time: Measured time for the update of F32 RMS is 7 microseconds
  *     for 128 block size.
  *
  * The average "power" is found by squaring the sample values, adding them
  * together and dividing by the number of samples.  The RMS value is a "voltage"
  * found by taking the square root of the power.  This is in DSP lingo, and
  * the units are vague. But, since usually, only relative values are important,
  * the units will cancel out!
  *
  * The two variables, accum and count, keep adding to the power sum until
  * a read() takes place. This is fine if the statistics of the input data are
  * stationary, i.e., not changing with time.  But, if the process is not
  * stationary, be aware and do read() at appropriate times.
